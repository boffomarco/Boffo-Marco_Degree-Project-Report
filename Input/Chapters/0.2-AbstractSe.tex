    \todo[inline]{All theses at KTH are required to have an abstract in both English and Swedish.\\
If you are writing your thesis in English, you can leave this until the final version. If you are writing your thesis in Swedish then this should be done first – and you should revise as necessary along the way.\\
If you are writing your thesis in English, then this section can be a summary targeted at a more general reader. However, if you are writing your thesis in Swedish, then the reverse is true – your abstract should be for your target audience, while an English summary can be written targeted at a more general audience.\\
This means that the English abstract and Swedish sammnfattning  
or Swedish abstract and English summary need not be literal translations of each other.\\

The abstract in the language used for the thesis should be the first abstract, while the Summary/Sammanfattning in the other language can follow.\\

Exchange students many want to include one or more abstracts in the language(s) used in their home institutions to avoid the neeed to write another thesis when returing to their home institution.
