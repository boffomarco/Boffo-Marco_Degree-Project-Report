	abstract = {Currently, the only mass-market service robots are floor cleaners and lawn mowers. Although available for more than 20 years, they mostly lack intelligent functions from modern robot research. In particular, the obstacle detection and avoidance is typically a simple physical collision detection. In this work, we discuss a prototype autonomous lawn mower with camera-based non-contact obstacle avoidance. We devised a low-cost compact module consisting of color cameras and an ARM-based processing board, which can be added to an autonomous lawn mower with minimal effort. For testing our system, we conducted a field test with 20 prototype units distributed in eight European countries with a total mowing time of 3,494 hours. The results show that our proposed system is able to work without expert interaction for a full season and strongly reduces collision events while still keeping the good mowing performance. Furthermore, a questionnaire with the testers revealed that most people would favor the camera-based mower over a non-camera-based mower.},

	abstract = {Robot lawn mowers currently available on the market mostly use a bounding cable that is installed at the edges of the lawn and around obstacles. This allows the robot to stay on the grass and not hit any obstacles. Installing this cable can be costly and time consuming, and it is difficult to change once in place. The purpose of this project is to evaluate if it is possible to develop a product that does not need the bounding cable. The result of this project is a prototype that navigates without the need of a bounding cable. Instead it uses a combination of a camera, GPS, and ultrasound sensors. The prototype can sufficiently navigate on a closed area and detecting obstacles. It can not detect non physical edges for example not visible property lines. The conclusion reached is that the techniques used in this project is useful for developing a robot lawn mower but that they all need some adjustment. Especially the GPS needs to be replaced or improved to gain the edge detection correctly.},

The developed adaptive Kalman filter is based on the maximum likelihood criterion for the proper choice of the filter weight and hence the filter gain factors. Results from two kinematic field tests in which the INS/GPS was compared to highly precise reference data are presented. Results show that the adaptive Kalman filter outperforms the conventional Kalman filter by tuning either the system noise variance–covariance (V–C) matrix `Q' or the update measurement noise V–C matrix `R' or both of them.},

	abstract = {The problem of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has received a great deal of attention within the robotics literature, and the importance of the solutions to this problem has been well documented for successful operation of autonomous agents in a number of environments. Of the numerous solutions that have been developed for solving the SLAM problem many of the most successful approaches continue to either rely on, or stem from, the Extended Kalman Filter method (EKF). However, the new algorithm FastSLAM has attracted attention for many properties not found in EKF based methods. One such property is the ability to deal with unknown data association and its robustness to data association errors. The problem of data association has also received a great deal of attention in the robotics literature in recent years, and various solutions have been proposed. In an effort to both compare the performance of the EKF and FastSLAM under ambiguous data association situations, as well as compare the performance of three different data association methods a comprehensive study of various SLAM filter-data association combinations is performed. This study will consist of pairing the EKF and FastSLAM filtering approaches with the Joint Compatibility, Sequential Compatibility Nearest Neighbor, and Joint Maximum Likelihood data association methods. The comparison will be based on both contrived simulations as well as application to the publicly available Car Park data set. The simulated results will demonstrate a heavy dependence on geometry, particularly landmark separation, for the performance of both filter performance and the data association algorithms used.},

	abstract = {The extended Kalman filter (EKF) has been the de facto approach to the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem for nearly fifteen years. However, the EKF has two serious deficiencies that prevent it from being applied to large, real-world environments: quadratic complexity and sensitivity to failures in data association. FastSLAM, an alternative approach based on the Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter, has been shown to scale logarithmically with the number of landmarks in the map. This efficiency enables FastSLAM to be applied to environments far larger than could be handled by the EKF. In this paper, we show that FastSLAM also substantially outperforms the EKF in environments with ambiguous data association. The performance of the two algorithms is compared on a real-world data set with various levels of odometric noise. In addition, we show how negative information can be incorporated into FastSLAM in order to improve the accuracy of the estimated map.},

	abstract = {Grid-based methods have been proposed to solve the Coverage Path Planning problem using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in irregular-shaped areas since simple geometric flight patterns, such as the back-and-forth, are inefficient in this type of scenario. However, the grid-based methods usually apply simplistic cost functions and demand high computational time leading to inefficient and expensive paths, making them not usable in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces an energy-aware grid-based approach aimed at minimizing energy consumption during mapping missions over irregular-shaped areas. Our work was built upon a previously proposed grid-based approach. Here we introduce an energy-aware cost function based on an accurate energy model. The proposed approach was able to save up to 17\% of energy in real flight experiments, proving that the original cost function was not capable of finding the optimal solution in terms of real energy measurements. Additional simulation experiments were also performed to state the energy savings in different irregular-shaped scenarios. As a further contribution, we also applied two pruning techniques to the original approach dropping the computation time up to 99\%.},

This paper gives attention to the development of a vision system that could contribute to the development of an automated vision based lawn mower robot. The works involve on the implementation of DIP techniques to detect and recognize three different types of obstacles that usually exist on a football field. The focus was given on the study on different types and sizes of obstacles, the development of vision based obstacle recognition system and the evaluation of the system's performance. Image processing techniques such as image filtering, segmentation, enhancement and edge detection have been applied in the system. The results have shown that the developed system is able to detect and recognize various types of obstacles on a football field with recognition rate of more 80\%.},

This task is integral to many robotic applications, such as vacuum cleaning robots, painter robots, autonomous underwater vehicles creating image mosaics, demining robots, lawn mowers, automated harvesters, window cleaners and inspection of complex structures, just to name a few. A considerable body of research has addressed the CPP problem. However, no updated surveys on CPP reflecting recent advances in the field have been presented in the past ten years. In this paper, we present a review of the most successful CPP methods, focusing on the achievements made in the past decade. Furthermore, we discuss reported field applications of the described CPP methods. This work aims to become a starting point for researchers who are initiating their endeavors in CPP. Likewise, this work aims to present a comprehensive review of the recent breakthroughs in the field, providing links to the most interesting and successful works.},

	abstract = {Information on obstacles (e.g., distances, scales, and categories) in the unstructured outdoor environment is crucial for a variety of robotic navigation tasks, such as obstacle avoidance, path planning, and security mechanism for pedestrians. However, most of the previous obstacle estimation methods merely focus on the detection of obstacles. In this paper, we propose a novel automatic obstacle estimation system that not only estimates distance and scale information but also can distinguish pedestrians from other barriers. The designed system comprises two branches, namely obstacle estimation and pedestrian detection. Obstacle estimation infers scales and depth clues from the disparity map using stereo vision, while pedestrian detection detects the pedestrian category by machine learning algorithms. We conduct the experiments on the mowing robot platform, and results show that our proposed system is highly effective. The furthest measurable distance is over 10 meters, while the maximum distance error rate is less than 5\%. In addition, the average accuracies of the obstacle estimation and pedestrian detection are 94\% and 97.6\%, respectively.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICCIS.2006.252275},
	abstract = {In this paper, two methods for detecting weeds in lawns using computer vision techniques are proposed. The first is based on an assumption about the differences in statistical values between the weed and grass areas in edge images and using Bayes classifier to discriminate them. The second also uses the differences in texture between both areas in edge images but instead applies only simple morphology operators. Correct weed detection rates range from 77.70 to 82.60\% for the first method and from 89.83 to 91.11\% for the second method. In addition, the proposed methods together with a chemical weeding system as well as a non-chemical weeding system based on pulse high voltage discharge are simulated and the efficiency of the overall systems are evaluated theoretically. With a chemical based system, more than 72\% of the weeds can be destroyed with a herbicide reduction rate of 90 to 94\% for both methods. For the latter weeding system, killed weed rate varies from 58\% to 85\%},

It can support an unlimited number of inputs from multiple sensor types, and allows users to customize which sensor data fields are fused with the current state estimate.

New results are: (1) The formulation and methods of solution of the problem apply without modification to stationary and nonstationary statistics and to growing-memory and infinite-memory filters. (2) A nonlinear difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation error. From the solution of this equation the co-efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are obtained without further calculations. (3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix.}",

ABSTRACT = {Human behaviour demonstrates environmental awareness and self-awareness which is used to arrive at decisions and actions or reach conclusions based on reasoning and inference. Environmental awareness and self-awareness are traits which autonomous robotic systems must have to effectively plan an optimal route and operate in dynamic operating environments. This paper proposes a novel approach to enable autonomous robotic systems to achieve efficient coverage path planning, which combines adaptation with knowledge reasoning techniques and hedge algebras to achieve optimal coverage path planning in multiple decision-making under dynamic operating environments. To evaluate the proposed approach we have implemented it in a mobile cleaning robot. The results demonstrate the ability to avoid static and dynamic (moving) obstacles while achieving efficient coverage path planning with low repetition rates. While alternative current coverage path planning algorithms have achieved acceptable results, our reported results have demonstrated a significant performance improvement over the alternative coverage path planning algorithms.},

	abstract = {Distributed as an open-source library since 2013, real-time appearance-based mapping (RTAB-Map) started as an appearance-based loop closure detection approach with memory management to deal with large-scale and long-term online operation. It then grew to implement simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) on various robots and mobile platforms. As each application brings its own set of constraints on sensors, processing capabilities, and locomotion, it raises the question of which SLAM approach is the most appropriate to use in terms of cost, accuracy, computation power, and ease of integration. Since most of SLAM approaches are either visual- or lidar-based, comparison is difficult. Therefore, we decided to extend RTAB-Map to support both visual and lidar SLAM, providing in one package a tool allowing users to implement and compare a variety of 3D and 2D solutions for a wide range of applications with different robots and sensors. This paper presents this extended version of RTAB-Map and its use in comparing, both quantitatively and qualitatively, a large selection of popular real-world datasets (e.g., KITTI, EuRoC, TUM RGB-D, MIT Stata Center on PR2 robot), outlining strengths, and limitations of visual and lidar SLAM configurations from a practical perspective for autonomous navigation applications.},

As is well known, the statistics of state process noise and measurement noise are critical factors to avoid numerical problems and obtain stable and accurate estimates. In this paper, a modified extended Kalman filter (EKF) is proposed by properly adapting the statistics of state process and observation noises through the innovation-based adaptive estimation (IAE) method. The impact of innovation perturbation produced by measurement outliers is found to account for positive feedback and numerical issues. Measurement noise covariance is updated based on a remodification algorithm according to measurement reliability specifications. An experimental field test was performed to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed state estimation method against dynamic model errors and measurement outliers.},

We term this estimation task visual–inertial odometry (VIO), in analogy to the well-known visual-odometry problem. We present a detailed study of extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based VIO algorithms, by comparing both their theoretical properties and empirical performance. We show that an EKF formulation where the state vector comprises a sliding window of poses (the multi-state-constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF)) attains better accuracy, consistency, and computational efficiency than the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) formulation of the EKF, in which the state vector contains the current pose and the features seen by the camera. Moreover, we prove that both types of EKF approaches are inconsistent, due to the way in which Jacobians are computed. Specifically, we show that the observability properties of the EKF’s linearized system models do not match those of the underlying system, which causes the filters to underestimate the uncertainty in the state estimates. Based on our analysis, we propose a novel, real-time EKF-based VIO algorithm, which achieves consistent estimation by (i) ensuring the correct observability properties of its linearized system model, and (ii) performing online estimation of the camera-to-inertial measurement unit (IMU) calibration parameters. This algorithm, which we term MSCKF 2.0, is shown to achieve accuracy and consistency higher than even an iterative, sliding-window fixed-lag smoother, in both Monte Carlo simulations and real-world testing.},

However, oscillated GPS measurements in the urban environment can lead to localization divergence easily. Moreover, heading estimation may be sensitive to magnetic interference if it relies on IMU with integrated magnetometer. This report tries to solve the localization problem on GPS oscillation and outage, based on adaptive extended Kalman filter(AEKF). In terms of the heading estimation, stereo visual odometry(VO) is fused to overcome the effect by magnetic disturbance. Vision-aided AEKF based algorithm is tested in the cases of both good GPS condition and GPS oscillation with magnetic interference. Under the situations considered, the algorithm is verified to outperform conventional extended Kalman filter(CEKF) and unscented Kalman filter(UKF) in position estimation by 53.74% and 40.09% respectively, and decrease the drifting of heading estimation. },

	abstract = {Robot localization is the process by which robots ascertain information about their position and orientation relative to the external environment through the use of sensors, a competency which is necessary for autonomous navigation.  Previous research has demonstrated significant increases in the accuracy of localization estimates when GPS data is used in concert with that of odometry and inertial measurements units in a process which utilizes sensor fusion.  A common algorithm to fuse data from multiple sensors so as to reduce the uncertainty in state estimation is the unscented Kalman filter (UKF), part of a family of similar filters.  The current project compares the efficacy of multiple localization schemes, including the use of the UKF, to determine position of an autonomous robot as it navigates paths in an open-world environment.  Contrary to previous research, the current project finds that the related extended Kalman filter slightly outperforms the UKF in localization tasks.},

	abstract = {Position in the environment is essential in any autonomous system. As increased accuracy is required, the costs escalate accordingly. This paper presents a simple way to systematically integrate sensory data to provide a drivable and accurate position solution at a low cost.

   The data fusion is handled by a Kalman filter tracking five states and an undetermined number of asynchronous measurements. This implementation allows the user to define additional adjustments to improve the overall behavior of the filter. The filter is tested using a suite of inexpensive sensors and then compared to a differential GPS position.

   The output of the filter is indeed a drivable solution that tracks the reference position remarkably well. This approach takes advantage of the short-term accuracy of odometry measurements and the long-term fix of a GPS unit. A maximum error of two meters of deviation from the reference is shown for a complex path over two minutes and 100 meters long.},

	abstract = {Summary The purpose of this chapter is to present state estimation techniques than can “adapt” themselves to certain types of uncertainties beyond those treated in earlier chapters—adaptive estimation algorithms. One type of uncertainty to be considered is the case of unknown inputs into the system, which typifies maneuvering targets. The other type will be a combination of system parameter uncertainties with unknown inputs where the system parameters (are assumed to) take values in a discrete set. The input estimation with state estimate correction technique is presented. The technique of estimating the input and, when “statistically significant,” augmenting the state with it (which leads to variable state dimension), is detailed. These two algorithms and the noise level switching technique are later compared. The design of an IMM estimator for air traffic control (ATC) is discussed in detail. Guidelines are also developed for when an adaptive estimator is really needed, i.e., when a (single model based) Kalman filter is not adequate. The chapter concludes with a brief presentation of the use of the extended Kalman filter for state and system parameter estimation. A problem solving section appears at the end of the chapter.}

The stated parameters rely on the probability values stored in the grid cells of the occupancy grid. Occupancy grid mapping is a proficient paradigm in the field of mobile robotics for modeling the environment by receiving the sensory information from range sensors. The objective of this study is to develop novel approach—adaptive sonar model (ASM)—for the generation of robust occupancy grid by reducing the effect of inconsistency in the grid cells probabilities of the occupancy as a consequence of long-range measurement. The results acquired with the implementation of the ASM techniques are compared with the conventional sonar sensor model which reveals 20\% reduction in the uncertainty in the occupancy grid map generated due to long-range measurement.},

	title = {On wrapping the {Kalman} filter and estimating with the {SO}(2) group},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05551},
	abstract = {This paper analyzes directional tracking in 2D with the extended Kalman filter on Lie groups (LG-EKF). The study stems from the problem of tracking objects moving in 2D Euclidean space, with the observer measuring direction only, thus rendering the measurement space and object position on the circle---a non-Euclidean geometry. The problem is further inconvenienced if we need to include higher-order dynamics in the state space, like angular velocity which is a Euclidean variables. The LG-EKF offers a solution to this issue by modeling the state space as a Lie group or combination thereof, e.g., SO(2) or its combinations with Rn. In the present paper, we first derive the LG-EKF on SO(2) and subsequently show that this derivation, based on the mathematically grounded framework of filtering on Lie groups, yields the same result as heuristically wrapping the angular variable within the EKF framework. This result applies only to the SO(2) and SO(2)xRn LG-EKFs and is not intended to be extended to other Lie groups or combinations thereof. In the end, we showcase the SO(2)xR2 LG-EKF, as an example of a constant angular acceleration model, on the problem of speaker tracking with a microphone array for which real-world experiments are conducted and accuracy is evaluated with ground truth data obtained by a motion capture system.},

	abstract = {Autonomous mobile robots are required to move throughout map the environment, locate themselves, and plan paths between positions. Vision stands out among the other senses for its richness and practicality. Even though there are well-established autonomous navigation solutions, as far as we can tell, no complete autonomous navigation system that is solely based on vision and that is suitable for dynamic indoor environments has fully succeeded. This article presents a systematic literature review of methods and techniques used to solve the complete autonomous navigation problem or its parts: localization, mapping, path planning, and locomotion. The focus of this review lays on vision-based methods for indoor environments and ground robots. A total of 121 studies were considered, comprising methods, conceptual models, and other literature reviews published between 2000 and 2017. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review about vision-based autonomous navigation suitable for dynamic indoor environments. It addresses navigation methods, autonomous navigation requirements, vision benefits, methods testing, and implementations validation. The results of this review show a deficiency in testing and validation of presented methods, poor requirements specification, and a lack of complete navigation systems in the literature. These results should encourage new works on computer vision techniques, requirements specification, development, integration, and systematic testing and validation of general navigation systems. In addition to these findings, we also present the complete methodology used for the systematic review, which provides a documentation of the process (allowing quality assessment and repeatability), the criteria for selecting and evaluating the studies, and a framework that can be used for future reviews in this research area.},
